# SWEN222_Game Stealth
Final Project for SWEN222 MMXV

Bieleski, Bryers, Gill and Thompson MMXV

Welcome to our game Stealth Pre Alpha! (working title)

The game has two teams, spies and guards. It is the spies' mission to capture the intel
to win the game and it is the guards duty to stop the spies by well, killing them.

Right now the game is run by running StartUpScreen.java

# Connecting

The hosting player should give out their IP address so the clients can connect to them.
The IP address can be obtained in the command line:
  
  Linux - # /sbin/ifconfig
  
  Windows - # /username/ipconfig
  
  Mac - # ifconfig |grep inet
  
# Controls

So far there are only movement controls, which are currently the arrow keys.
