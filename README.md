# Stealth
Final Project for SWEN222 MMXV

Bieleski, Bryers, Gill and Thompson MMXV

Welcome to our game Stealth Pre Alpha! (working title)

The game has two teams, spies and guards. It is the spies' mission to capture the intel
to win the game and it is the guards duty to stop the spies by well, killing them.

The game as of now only has basic functionality, proper game mechanics are on the way.

Right now the game is run by running StartUpScreen.java

# Starting a game

To start a new game the press the "Host" button and enter a username. Please make sure your username is different
from everyone elses. Same usernames may cause unwanted bugs.

To join a user should run a new game, press "Client" and enter a username as well.

# Connecting (Local)

If you are running multiple games on the same computer you do not have to enter an IP address as it is already defaulted to "localhost".

# Connecting (Over the internet)

The IP address can be obtained in the command line:

  Mac - # ifconfig |grep inet
